      <p>
        Welcome to SFL Insights, your gateway to powerful text and image analysis tools grounded in the principles of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL). Whether you're a student, researcher, or linguist, our tools are designed to support deep and structured analyses of meaning in both language and visuals.
      </p>

      <h2>üìò SFL Text Analysis Tool</h2>
      <p>
        This tool performs comprehensive linguistic analysis based on the SFL framework established by Halliday and Matthiessen (2014) and enriched by the Appraisal theory from Martin and White (2005). It examines your text through:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ideational Metafunction (experiential and logical meanings)</li>
        <li>Interpersonal Metafunction (mood, modality, appraisal)</li>
        <li>Textual Metafunction (theme/rheme, cohesion, nominalization, and more)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each analysis provides rich linguistic tagging and detailed commentary to help you understand how language constructs meaning.
      </p>

      <h2>üñºÔ∏è SFL Image Analysis Tool</h2>
      <p>
        Based on the visual grammar framework of Kress and van Leeuwen (2001), this tool allows you to analyze the meaning-making structures in images. It explores:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Representational meanings (narrative and conceptual structures)</li>
        <li>Interpersonal meanings (gaze, size, angle, and social distance)</li>
        <li>Compositional meanings (information value, salience, and framing)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This tool supports educators, designers, and researchers in uncovering the communicative functions embedded in visuals.
